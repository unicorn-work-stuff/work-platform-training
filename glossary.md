# API, REST API, Integration, and MuleSoft Glossary

## API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools for building software and applications. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other.

## REST API (Representational State Transfer API)
A type of API that conforms to the principles of REST, an architectural style that uses HTTP requests for communication between systems.

## Endpoint
A specific URL path that represents an object or collection of objects in an API. Endpoints define where resources lie and where operations can be performed.

## HTTP Methods
Methods used in REST APIs to perform operations on resources. The common methods are:
- **GET:** Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST:** Send data to a server to create a resource.
- **PUT:** Update an existing resource on the server.
- **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server.

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Often used in REST APIs for request and response payloads.

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Sometimes used in APIs for data exchange.

## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
A protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. SOAP relies on XML as its message format.

## OAuth (Open Authorization)
An open standard for access delegation commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization.

## Swagger
An open-source framework for designing, building, documenting, and consuming REST APIs. It uses OpenAPI Specification (OAS).

## OpenAPI Specification (OAS)
A standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, allowing both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code.

## API Gateway
A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then passing the response back to the requester.

## Throttling
A process used to control the usage rate of an API by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a certain period.

## Rate Limiting
A technique to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network.

## Payload
The body of a request or response message in an API, containing the data being transferred.

## Middleware
Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what is offered by the operating system. In the context of APIs, middleware often handles requests and responses.

## MuleSoft

## Connector
A component in MuleSoft that enables a Mule application to interact with a specific protocol or external system.

## Flow
The building block of a Mule application, consisting of a series of processors that handle message processing.

## Message Processor
A component in a Mule flow that processes messages, such as transformers, filters, and routers.

## API Manager

## CloudHub
MuleSoft's cloud-based integration platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) that allows deploying and managing Mule applications in the cloud.

## RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language)
A YAML-based language for defining RESTful APIs, used in designing and documenting APIs.

## Webhook
A method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. These are usually triggered by some event.

## Microservices
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.

## ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)
A software architecture model used for designing and implementing communication between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented architecture (SOA).

## Service Mesh
A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication, usually in a microservices architecture.

## API Economy
The global exchange of value that is enabled by the use of APIs, allowing businesses to create new business models and value chains.

## Integration
The process of linking together different computing

systems and software applications physically or functionally, to act as a coordinated whole.

## iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service)
A cloud-based service that provides a platform for building and deploying integrations within the cloud and between the cloud and enterprise systems.

## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
A design pattern where services are provided to other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.

## API Lifecycle
The stages an API goes through from creation to retirement. This includes design, development, testing, deployment, management, and deprecation.

## API Analytics
The process of collecting, measuring, and analyzing usage data from APIs to understand their performance and usage patterns.

## SDK (Software Development Kit)
A set of software tools and libraries provided to help developers create applications for a specific platform or service.

## API Proxy
A server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers, often used to add a layer of security and manage API traffic.

## API Versioning
The practice of managing changes to an API by creating different versions, allowing clients to continue using the old versions while new features are added in the new versions.

## RESTful Service
A web service that follows the principles of REST, providing interoperability between computer systems on the internet.

## SOAP Service
A web service that uses SOAP protocol for communication, often with more rigid standards and more extensive features than RESTful services.

## Message Queue
A form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures, where messages are stored in a queue until they are processed by a receiving service.

## Circuit Breaker
A design pattern used in microservices architecture to prevent cascading failures by stopping the invocation of a service that is likely to fail.

## API Monetization
The process of generating revenue from APIs by charging for API usage, offering premium features, or implementing subscription models.

## SLA (Service Level Agreement)
